## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Vector

You can creat vector with c() function

## Matrix

1. cbind(x,y) create matrix by combining vector x and y of equal lenght

2. t(name_of_matrix) is used to transpose matrix

3. dim(name_of_matrix) tells the dimensionality of matrix

4. directly list elements and specify matrix

```
m2<-matrix(c(1,3,2,5,-1,2,2,3,9),nrow=3)

m2
```

```
 [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    5    2
[2,]    3   -1    3
[3,]    2    2    9

```
5. matrices are tabular data structures. We can subset them using []

we can subset m2 matrix

subset based on row

`m2[2,]`
```
[1]  3 -1  3
```

subset based on column

`m2[, 2]`
```
[1]  5 -1  2
```
subset based on row and column

`m2[2:3, 2:3]`
```
[,1] [,2]
[1,]   -1    3
[2,]    2    9
```

`m2[1:2, 2:3]`
```
[,1] [,2]
[1,]    5    2
[2,]   -1    3
```

## Data frames

1. data.frame() function is used to construct data frame.

```
> chr <- c("chr1", "chr1", "chr2", "chr2")
> strand <- c("-","-","+","+")
> start<- c(200,4000,100,400)
> end<-c(250,410,200,450)
> mydata <- data.frame(chr,start,end,strand)
```

#change column names

`>names(mydata) <- c("chr","start","end","strand")`

### OR this will work too

`>mydata <- data.frame(chr=chr,start=start,end=end,strand=strand)`

`>mydata`
```
chr start end strand
1 chr1   200 250      -
2 chr1  4000 410      -
3 chr2   100 200      +
4 chr2   400 450      +
```

### Data frames are tabular data structures. We can subset them using []

### subset data frame

`mydata[,2:4]` # columns 2,3,4 of data frame


`mydata[, c(1,3)]` #column 1,3 of data frame


`mydata[,c("chr","start")]` # columns chr and start from data frame


`mydata$start` # variable start in the data frame


`mydata[c(1,3),]` # get 1st and 3rd rows


`mydata[mydata$start>400,]` # get all rows where start>400

## List

list can be created with list() function.

```
#example of a list with 4 components
#a string, a numeric vector, a matrix, and a scalar

w <- list(name="Fred",
       mynumbers=c(1,2,3),
       mymatrix=matrix(1:4,ncol=2),
       age=5.3)
```

### Elements of a list can be extracted using the [[]], double square-bracket

`w[[3]]` # 3rd component of the list

`w[["mynumbers"]]` # component named mynumbers in list

`w$age` # component named age in list

## Factors

Factors are used to store categorical data using factor() function.

```
features=c("promoter","exon","intron")
f.feat=factor(features)
```

## Data types

1. numeric

#create a numeric vector x with 5 components

`x<-c(1,3,2,10,5)`

2. logical

#create a logical vector x

`x<-c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)`

3. character

# create a character vector

`x<-c("sds","sd","as")`

4. integer

# create an integer vector

`x<-c(1L,2L,3L)` # L is used to change numeric value as integer

`class(x)` # check the type pf the data
